    "# Millenials and Investment: an Ongoing Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you haven't heard, [millenials are killing everything](http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8/#diamonds-12) from diamonds to department stores to designer crap to grocery chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Sure, the recession had an impact. But also, millenials pay more attention to ethics than many multinational corporations bargain for. They cite the blood diamond trade as a major reason to spring for non-traditional engagement rings. They opt for grocery providers that can tell them where their food is coming from and under what conditions it was produced. They're ditching the fast fashion industry for higher-priced items purchased secondhand on sites like Poshmark and ThreadUp. \n",
    "\n",
    "And as millenials reach the age where they might accrue some savings, it makes sense that they would care about where that is going, too. In addition to millenial attendance at the NoDAPL protests, we saw thousands of millenials divest from Western Union, Bank of America, and other banks that loaned money to the project. Maybe megacorps won't change their tunes because a few thousand people stood in a field to get mowed down by water cannons, but they're more likely to sit up and listen when those same people take their hard-earned doll hairs to another playhouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that millenials are surveying their options to spend and save according to their values. What about investing? Any personal finance 101 that isn't taught by a financial advisor will recommend a low cost index as the place to stick extra money so it can grow with the market. Most index funds, including the most recommended one (Vanguard), decide their investments via index-matching: matching their holdings to the S&P500 by market cap, with no other variables. Thing is, plenty of investors are expressing interest in taking ethical considerations into account. Some portfolios do this by blanket blocking investments in certain industries like tobacco or porn. Other more advanced optsions, like Betterment's AutoSRI portfolio, use actual ESG data to determine where they invest the money. There isn't (yet) a fully customizable option to allow folks to automatically invest their funds based on a checklist of their individual values. For a while, I've thought about building a toy version of what that might look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I talk about the idea with friends and relatives, I get the following objection: 'What about the returns?' Touche. Nobody wants to lose out on their potential earnings. At first, I figured I'd build a tolerance into the system that allowed investors to say 'These are my values, but please don't invest in a way that will trail general market performance by more than x percent.' The algorithm would then predict stock performance for each company, somehow blend that with ESG rating, and come up with a combined weight for divvying up investment money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I build that, though, I need to test the assumption that high ESG ratings *do* correlate negatively with returns. If they don't, there's no need for the tolerance measure in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not the first person to run correlations along these lines. Dorfleitner, Utz, and Wimmer published a paper on this just last year. [Their analysis](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20430795.2017.1403272?scroll=top&needAccess=true) suggests that higher corporate social responsibility ratings *increase* returns over a long period of time (\"long\" being a 12 year period from 2002-2014). They even identify three specific areas that correlate with higher than average returns: emission and resource reduction, workforce, and society. So in my exploration, I'll dig into some specific CSR breakdowns with the data I have on S&P 500 companies. "

So the \"true average\" of something might not look like the average of our measurements of it, and the fewer measurements we have the less sure we can be of the discrepancy.

    "The thing about a lot of our data is that it skews heavily toward one side or the other. For example, there are a lot more companies with low employment policy strength scores than high ones. How do we account for this when we do our aggregations? In the code below, I try to separate strata of ESG scores into buckets of similar size.

This isn't exaclty continuous data as the ESG aggregations are all natural numbers, _but_ that is not the reason for the buckets. The reason for the buckets is to have each of our aggregated data points come from roughly the same number of data examples. If we run a regressor, the bottom of the regressor represents a ton of data points, and as we go higher it represents fewer and fewer data points such that the expected value up there means very little. \n",

Scientists, collectively, test a _whole bunch_ of stuff to see what has an effect. Most of the things tried, it turns out, don't have that effect. So our `accept_null_hypothesis` value will usually be true. When it's false, we should sit up and pay attention."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "On this pass, we have taken a much more thorough look at our data with respect to how well it approximates the real world and how certain we are about that approximation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This did not mean tacking on a test for statistical significance at the end: it meant rethinking our analysis from the very beginning, including _what our target variable would be_ (previously extrapolated annual roi, now back to mean quarterly roi) and also _how we would represent it_ (with the bottom end of the confidence interval instead of the mean itself). \n",
    "\n",
    "It also meant checking our results more thoroughly along the way, identifying unrealistic values in the data, understanding why those values were what they were, and replacing them with values that better approximate reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it meant conducting a t test rather than eyeballing the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result here provides an excellent example of the difference between how data might be interpreted or perceived versus what it really represents. When we use the bottom of the confidence intervals, we're looking at a _lot_ of _losses_ in shareholder value. It's important to note that this isn't really what happened. It is, more accurately, a statistically derived worst-case scenario for a company that did everything that a given example company did, based on the metrics we have about how that company actually did. That is _not useful_ for predicting what the stock returns for the example company will be in the future (fun fact: trying to predict stock returns in general is not that useful, as straight-up index matching outperforms the vast majority of shrewder, prediction-based investment strategies in the long term. I don't miss our loss of predictive value because there wasn't much demonstrated value there to begin with.)\n",
    "\n",
    "At any rate, what it _is_ useful for is accurately representing the fact that there is a lot we do not know and attempting to account for that in a comparison of stock returns relative to ESG ratings. We're not trying to predict returns by company: we're trying to determine if companies with favorable ESG scores, in aggregate, underperform on the stock market relative to companies with unfavorable ESG scores. For this, our data is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, as we've established, we don't see in this analysis a meaningful difference in most cases. In the one case where we do see a meaningful difference, the companies with favorable ESG scores are in fact outperforming the companies with unfavorable ESG scores. All of this bodes well for the _application_ question—can I create a socially conscious investment portfolio without sacrificing returns on my investment?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's more to look at to get a more definitive answer to this question. But so far, what we're seeing points to _yes_. "

    "While I am much happier with our process in this run of the notebook, I am highly dissatisfied with the state of the code. It's very scripty, parts of it feel repetitive, and it all has to be run in order because I reused variable names. I would call the work up to this point an _exploration phase_. If I were to ship this work for any kind of reuse, I'd like it to look nothing like this. Maybe we'll make that a follow-up post later about this notebook, or maybe we'll focus more on that in our next note book series."
